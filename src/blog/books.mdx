import Aside from "/src/components/Aside.astro"

In which I write a little about books that I really really liked. 
I do not write too much about them because
A) I do not want to,
and 
B) I want you to find out. 

I have another (secret) list of books that I loathed but I will not talk about that here. 
It's really easy to prompt me to rant about some of them though, so there's a conversational cheat code you can exploit. 


# Children of Time

If I had a nickle for each time I read a book by Adrian Tchaikovsky and the theme was "spiders and empathy", I'd have two nickels. 
Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice. 

Disliking spiders might actually add to the literary experience, but I do not know that with certainty because I love spiders ♥♥♥ 


# The Murderbot Diaries

This is comfort food in literary form. 
When a new book in this series releases I retreat into bed for an entire day and then regret that because I read it too quickly. 

They made a TV adaptation of the first book and I actually really liked it. 
One should definitely watch the show *and* read the book though. 
Or read the book *and* watch the show. 
They compliment each other really well. 


# They Thought They Were Free 

World War II ends and the author travels to germany to befriend ten nazis. 
He records their stories and worldviews. 
This book casts light on disturbing aspects of the human psyche and I think that more people should read it, especially in our current times. 


# Unmasking Autism 

In which some guy talks about autism and directly calls me out every three paragraphs or so. 
Maybe he's calling you out too? 
Idk go read it. 


# Whipping Girl

This is where the term "transmisogyny" came from! 
It is a bit dated, but most of the general concepts hold true. 
It should be required reading for everyone before they talk to me. 
Unfortunately, I have not yet found a means to enforce this...
