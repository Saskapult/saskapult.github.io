I like cute things, and I made some cute things recently! 
I cannot justify having individual pages for each cute thing, so this page shows them all. 

The Ferris plushie was made using [this tutorial](https://edunham.net/2016/04/11/plushie_rustacean_pattern.html). 
I think that crabs are very cute. 
I also love the rust programming language. 
It is a great combination for me! 

This was the first plushie I'd made, so I didn't really know what I was doing while I made it. 
All of its seams use a manually-sewn backstitch, which was time-consuming and difficult to use with the many tuns on this plushie. 
If I was to make another, I'd try using a tight running stitch. 

The bee was made by following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9bjNCo3dk4). 
I often wish that I could cuddle a fluffy bumblebee, but they are too small and I am too large. 
I think that bees are very cute. 
And I love minecraft! 
It is, again, a great combination for me.

Both projects use arctic fleece. 
This material was chosen due to how fluffy it is and how well it holds together. 
In the future I would rather use something like it but biodegradable. 
While I do adore these plushies, their materials could outlive me by several centuries and that might be a problem.
