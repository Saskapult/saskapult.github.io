I like cute things, and I made some cute things! 
I cannot justify having individual pages for each cute thing, so this page shows them all. 

The Ferris plushie was made using [this tutorial](https://edunham.net/2016/04/11/plushie_rustacean_pattern.html). 
It was the first plushie I'd made so I didn't really know what I was doing. 
All of its seams use a backstitch, which was time-consuming and difficult to use for the many tuns on this plushie. 
If I was to make another, I'd try using a tight running stitch. 

The bee was made by following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9bjNCo3dk4). 

Both projects use arctic fleece. 
I want to find something like it but biodegradable.

Look at how pretty they are!
