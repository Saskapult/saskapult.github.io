I love chai. 
I want to drink a lot of chai. 
But restaurant chai is expensive! 
I have been obsessing over this recipe and I think it's finally good though to share. 

**Ingredients:**
- 2c water
- 1c milk
- 5 green cardamom 
- 1/2 black cardamom 
- 2 cloves
- 2.5cm cinnamon 
- 4 peppercorns 
- 1 leaf star anise 
- 2ts tea
- 1ts ginger, peeled 

**Directions:**
- Place ginger in toaster on broil setting, remove after 5 minutes
	- Allegedly improves flavour, but I don't notice much of a difference 
- Put water in small saucepan. Place saucepan on stove over medium heat
- Crush other spices, place crushed spices and ginger into the saucepan 
- Let simmer 10 minutes 
- Add tea leaves
- Let simmer 10 minutes
- Add milk until volume is approximately doubled 
	- I like milky chai, but it's a matter of personal preference 
- Leave the heat as it is for 10 minutes
- Turn off heat 
- Let sit 10 minutes 
- Filter and serve
