Hi I'm Katherine and this is where I put things. 
It's a personal website, so you will be able to see many different things! 
We have technical articles, recipes, plushie crafting, and more!

The design of this place is inspired by designs found on [neocities.org](https://neocities.org/). 
The people on there are very creative and I like that! 

I am not sure of what else to put here?

Feels kinda empty.

Ooo how about some links?

Here's the [thesaurus](https://onelook.com/thesaurus/) that I like to use. 

{/* <Aside type="quote" title="">
	You hold your hand against the hot stove, believing that if you suffer long enough you'll become stronger.

<Aside type="quote" title="">
	Universal laws suggest that something will break. 
	It can either be you or an obstacle in your path. 

	Odds are it will be you at some point, but there's also a chance the universe will instead.
