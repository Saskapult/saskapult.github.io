# About Me
Hi! I'm Katherine and I am doomed to suffer for all time. 

I made this site to show off things that I like. 

Do you want some fine [masala chai](/blog/chai)?
Want to learn about [weird medieval fruit](/blog/meadlar)? 
Or perhaps you want to sit down and [read](/blog/books) a bit?
Make a [plushie](/blog/plushies) or two?

Or perhaps you are an employer and would be more interested in [research](/blog/ego_search) or [implementation](/blog/harmonic) or [optimization](/blog/lerp3)?

I do a lot of things. 
You should hire me. 

But I do not know who you are. 

You know a little about me now though and that's a bit scary.

	You hold your hand against the hot stove, believing that if you suffer long enough you'll become stronger.

<Aside type="quote" title="">
	Universal laws suggest that something will break. 
	It can either be you or an obstacle in your path. 

	Odds are it will be you at some point, but there's also a chance the universe will instead.
