Run Run Pagliacci ([itch](https://hedge-lord.itch.io/run-run-pagliacci), [github](https://github.com/Saskapult/run-run-pagliacci), [global game jam](https://globalgamejam.org/games/2024/run-run-pagliacci-6)) is a game about a clown trying to outrun their sadness. 

The game is a very simple platformer. 
You control Pagliacci, and must progress toward the right side of the screen in order to outrun their sadness. 
Along the way, Pagliacci must avoid slipping on bananas and being hit by shopping carts. 
The goal is to avoid crying in public! 

This was made at the Global Game Jam 2024 event in Fort Techtoria, Victoria, BC. 
The space was a bit cramped but it was quite cozy! 
One thing I was impressed by was the sheer amount of snacks available for the event.

This was my first solo game jam entry, and it turned out pretty well. 
A minimum viable product was produced 24 hours into the 48-hour game jam. 
I'd spent a lot of that sleeping though, so I'm not sure whether to count that.
