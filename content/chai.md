I love chai. 
I want to drink a lot of chai. 
But restaurant chai is expensive! 
I have been obsessing over this recipe and I think it's finally good though to share. 

While this chai is good, it's only around half as good as the stuff you can get at Heritage Indian Cuisine in Duncan, BC, Canada. 
I'm not sure how they manage to pack so much flavour into one cup of liquid. 
I'd highly recommend visiting there and ordering some food, everything they have is delicious. 

UPDATE 2025-06-16:

I've done it! 
I've broken the flavour barrier! 
How did I do this? 
I used 3% fat milk! 
And it made the thing around twice as good! 

**Ingredients:**
- 2c water
- 1c milk
- 5 green cardamom 
- 1/2 black cardamom 
- 2 cloves
- 2.5cm cinnamon 
- 4 peppercorns 
- 1 leaf star anise 
- 2ts tea
- 1ts ginger, peeled 

**Directions:**
- Place ginger in toaster on broil setting, remove after 5 minutes
	- Allegedly improves flavour, but I don't notice much of a difference 
- Put water in small saucepan. Place saucepan on stove over medium heat
- Crush other spices, place crushed spices and ginger into the saucepan 
- Let simmer 10 minutes 
- Add tea leaves
- Let simmer 10 minutes
- Add milk until volume is approximately doubled 
	- I like milky chai, but it's a matter of personal preference 
- Leave the heat as it is for 10 minutes
- Turn off heat 
- Let sit 10 minutes 
- Filter and serve
